# Data Visualisations - Power BI
Hello, welcome to my Portfolio Projects page! Here is where I will go in depth in various datasets, showcasing my PowerBI skills and knowledge. I hope you enjoy my data Visualisations!
- i have done visualisations on the following things
- imdb movie analysis
- sales report analysis
- banking churn analysis
- for the above visualisations i got datasets from kaggle and then cleaned according to my requirements then created some columns and measures using DAX and connected many dimension tables to the facts table to gather informations and finally with the help of these things i created dashboards.
